# rsautil
Golang RSA utilities

Based off many public gists and personal need to not reinvent the wheel every time I need to manage RSA keys.

### Usage
```go
import (
    "github.acacio.com/rsautil"
}
```


### Credits

Based of [this](https://gist.github.com/miguelmota/4ea9286bd1d3c2a985b67cac4ba2130a) gist but with error return handling, added Sign / Verifi (WIP) and testing.
